Listed in this file are all the versions and configurations which were used to make pythonPiper function on an ARM processor.
    This is for deployment on a Raspberry Pi (a 3B 1.2 in my case)

Numpy - Version 1.16.2

TensorFlow (v2.0.0)-
    Required Dependencies: (may be installed with apt-get) 
        1) libhdf5-dev 
        2) libc-ares-dev 
        3) libeigen3-dev
        4) openmpi-bin 
        5) libopenmpi-dev
        6) libatlas-base-dev
    
    Required python Dependencies: (may be installed with pip3)
        1) keras_applications==1.0.8
        2) keras_preprocessing==1.1.0
        3) h5py==2.9.0

    note: you may also require "pip3 install -U six wheel mock"

    TensorFlow Wheel (wget): https://github.com/lhelontra/tensorflow-on-arm/releases/download/v2.0.0/tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl

    install the wheel with: "pip3 install tensorflow-2.0.0-cp37-none-linux_armv7l.whl"


to quickly check the install, open a python interpreter and run the following commands:
    "import tensorflow"
    "tensorflow.__version__"
    output should be "2.0.0" with no warnings or errors
